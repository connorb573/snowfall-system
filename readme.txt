This was my first attempt at creating a particle system using OpenGL, I chose to simulate a basic snowfall, where
the user can manipulate some aspects of the snow, such as its size and opacity, and also move around the scene. 
To make the application more interesting, I implemented ground-snow accumulation based on code I found elsewhere, this can be
seen in the main particles.cpp file.
